# car_renting_management
THIS IS A WINDOWS APPLICATION!

Dedicated to Car Agencies. This Win App Helps to control the car renting: reservations, cars, clients also professionnals or employees.

I used While developping it, the MVC Architecture which is an architectural pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides an application into three interconnected parts (DATA ACCESS LAYER, BUSINESS LAYER & PRESENTATION LAYER). This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.

To try this WinApp correctly, first you need to install Microsoft SQL Server (2010 or newest), and copy the Database in the Database folder then paste it in the DATA SQL Folder. Secondly, open the Management SQL Server, then connect your database with the server (usually called SQLEXPRESS). 
Finally, if you have Visual Studio, open the project and run it.
